<h3 id="2-Content"><a href="#2-Content" class="headerlink" title="2. Content"></a>2. Content</h3><blockquote><br>Seven times I have despised my soul:<br>The first time when I saw her being meek that she might attain height.<br>The second time when I saw her limping before the crippled.<br>The third time when she was given to choose between the hard and the easy, and she chose the easy.<br>The fourth time when she committed a wrong, and comforted herself that others also commit wrong.<br>The fifth time when she forbore for weakness, and attributed her patience to strength.<br>The sixth time when she despised the ugliness of a face, and knew not that it was one of her own masks.<br>And the seventh time when she sang a song of praise, and deemed it a virtue<br><br>纪伯伦 《沙与沫》 （节选）<br>曾有七次我鄙视我的灵魂：<br>第一次，当我看到她可以升迁却退让时<br>第二次，当我看到她在瘸者面前跛足前行时<br>第三次，当她处在难易之间而选择了易时<br>第四次，当她犯了错，却安慰自己说别人也会犯错时<br>第五次，当她因为懦弱而忍耐，却自认为坚忍时<br>第六次，当她鄙视一张人面的丑陋，却不知道那正是自己面具的一张时<br>第七次，当她唱着颂歌并自以为是一种美德时<br></blockquote><br><a id="more"></a><br><br><blockquote><br>All(全文):<br>I AM FOREVER walking upon these shores,<br>Betwixt the sand and the foam,<br>The high tide will erase my foot-prints,<br>And the wind will blow away the foam.<br>But the sea and the shore will remain<br>Forever.<br><br>Once I filled my hand with mist.<br>Then I opened it and lo, the mist was a worm.<br>And I closed and opened my hand again, and behold there was a bird.<br>And again I closed and opened my hand, and in its hollow stood a man with a sad face, turned upward.<br>And again I closed my hand, and when I opened it there was naught but mist.<br>But I heard a song of exceeding sweetness.<br><br>It was but yesterday I thought myself a fragment quivering without rhythm in the sphere of life.<br>Now I know that I am the sphere, and all life in rhythmic fragments moves within me.<br><br>They say to me in their awakening, “You and the world you live in are but a grain of sand upon the infinite shore of an infinite sea.”<br>And in my dream I say to them, “I am the infinite sea, and all worlds are but grains of sand upon my shore.”<br><br>Only once have I been made mute. It was when a man asked me, “Who are you?”<br><br>The first thought of God was an angel.<br>The first word of God was a man.<br><br>We were fluttering, wandering, longing creatures a thousand thousand years before the sea and the wind in the forest gave us words.<br>Now how can we express the ancient of days in us with only the sounds of our yesterdays?<br><br>The Sphinx spoke only once, and the Sphinx said, “A grain of sand is a desert, and a desert is a grain of sand; and now let us all be silent again.”<br>I heard the Sphinx, but I did not understand.<br><br>Long did I lie in the dust of Egypt, silent and unaware of the seasons.<br>Then the sun gave me birth, and I rose and walked upon the banks of the Nile,<br>Singing with the days and dreaming with the nights.<br>And now the sun threads upon me with a thousand feet that I may lie again in the dust of Egypt.<br>But behold a marvel and a riddle!<br>The very sun that gathered me cannot scatter me.<br>Still erect am I, and sure of foot do I walk upon the banks of the Nile.<br><br>Remembrance is a form of meeting.<br><br>Forgetfulness is a form of freedom.<br><br>We measure time according to the movement of countless suns; and they measure time by little machines in their little pockets.<br>Now tell me, how could we ever meet at the same place and the same time?<br><br>Space is not space between the earth and the sun to one who looks down from the windows of the Milky Way.<br><br>Humanity is a river of light running from the ex-eternity to eternity.<br><br>Do not the spirits who dwell in the ether envy man his pain?<br><br>On my way to the Holy City I met another pilgrim and I asked him, “Is this indeed the way to the Holy City?”<br>And he said, “Follow me, and you will reach the Holy City in a day and a night.”<br>And I followed him. And we walked many days and many nights, yet we did not reach the Holy City.<br>And what was to my surprise he became angry with me because he had misled me.<br><br>Make me, oh God, the prey of the lion, ere You make the rabbit my prey.<br><br>One may not reach the dawn save by the path of the night.<br><br>My house says to me, “Do not leave me, for here dwells your past.”<br>And the road says to me, “Come and follow me, for I am your future.”<br>And I say to both my house and the road, “I have no past, nor have I a future. If I stay here, there is a going in my staying; and if I go there is a staying in my going. Only love and death will change all things.”<br><br>How can I lose faith in the justice of life, when the dreams of those who sleep upon feathers are not more beautiful than the dreams of those who sleep upon the earth? Strange, the desire for certain pleasures is a part of my pain.<br><br>Seven times have I despised my soul:<br>The first time when I saw her being meek that she might attain height.<br>The second time when I saw her limping before the crippled.<br>The third time when she was given to choose between the hard and the easy, and she chose the easy.<br>The fourth time when she committed a wrong, and comforted herself that others also commit wrong.<br>The fifth time when she forbore for weakness, and attributed her patience to strength.<br>The sixth time when she despised the ugliness of a face, and knew not that it was one of her own masks.<br>And the seventh time when she sang a song of praise, and deemed it a virtue.<br><br>I AM IGNORANT of absolute truth.

It is better poetry.<br>But you and all my neighbors agree that I always choose badly.<br><br>Poetry is not an opinion expressed.

The truth of the matter seems to lie between us.<br><br>Your other self is always sorry for you.

It is in our tears and in the sea.<br><br>Our God in His gracious thirst will drink us all, the dewdrop and the tear.<br><br>You are but a fragment of your giant self, a mouth that seeks bread, and a blind hand that holds the cup for a thirsty mouth.<br><br>If you would rise but a cubit above race and country and self you would indeed become godlike.<br><br>If I were you I would not find fault with the sea at low tide.<br>It is a good ship and our Captain is able; it is only your stomach that is in disorder.<br><br>Should you sit upon a cloud you would not see the boundary line between one country and another, nor the boundary stone between a farm and a farm.<br>It is a pity you cannot sit upon a cloud.<br><br>Seven centuries ago seven white doves rose from a deep valley flying to the snow-white summit of the mountain. One of the seven men who watched the flight said, “I see a black spot on the wing of the seventh dove.”<br>Today the people in that valley tell of seven black doves who flew to the summit of the snowy mountain.<br><br>In the autumn I gathered all my sorrows and buried them in my garden.<br>And when April returned and spring came to wed the earth, there grew in my garden beautiful flowers unlike all other flowers.<br>And my neighbors came to behold them, and they all said to me, “When autumn comes again, at seeding time, will you not give us of the seeds of these flowers that we may have them in our gardens?”<br><br>It is indeed misery if I stretch an empty hand to men and receive nothing; but it is hopelessness if I stretch a full hand and find none to receive.<br><br>I long for eternity because there I shall meet my unwritten poems and my unpainted pictures.<br><br>Art is a step from nature toward the Infinite.<br><br>A work of art is a mist carved into an image.<br><br>Even the hands that make crowns of thorns are better than idle hands.<br><br>Our most sacred tears never seek our eyes.<br><br>Every man is the descendant of every king and every slave that ever lived.<br><br>If the great-grandfather of Jesus had known what was hidden within him, would he not have stood in awe of himself?<br><br>Was the love of Judas’ mother of her son less than the love of Mary for Jesus?<br><br>There are three miracles of our Brother Jesus not yet recorded in the Book: the first that He was a man like you and me, the second that He had a sense of humour, and the third that He knew He was a conqueror though conquered.<br><br>Crucified One, you are crucified upon my heart; and the nails that pierce your hands pierce the walls of my heart.<br>And tomorrow when a stranger passes by this Golgotha he will not know that two bled here.<br>He will deem it the blood of one man.<br><br>You may have heard of the Blessed Mountain.<br>It is the highest mountain in our world.<br>Should you reach the summit you would have only one desire, and that to descend and be with those who dwell in the deepest valley.<br>That is why it is called the Blessed Mountain.<br><br>Every thought I have imprisoned in expression I must free by my deeds.<br></blockquote>
